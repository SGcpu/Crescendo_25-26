# Council Logos Directory

This directory contains logo images for all participating councils in Crescendo 2025-26.

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG or SVG with transparent background preferred
- **Size**: Aim for dimensions around 200x200px (1:1 ratio)
- **Naming convention**: `[council-name-lowercase].png` (e.g., `ieee.png`, `csi.png`)

## Adding New Logos

1. Place your logo image file in this directory
2. Follow the naming convention: lowercase council name with no spaces
3. Ensure the image has a transparent background when possible
4. Optimize the image size for web (you can use tools like TinyPNG)

## Used By

These logos are used in the InfiniteScroll component in `FeaturedEvents.tsx` to display a dynamic, tilted scrolling animation of council logos.
